<<<<<<< HEAD
I've studied a variety of systems so far: tropical coral reefs from 0 - 100 m under the sea, temperate jellyfish blooms,  and climate change and fishing in the Arctic. I leant heavily on my coding skills for all of these projects, for modelling and machine learning, which means I'm somehow in a maths department after a biology degree! Despite the programming I've plenty of field experience, which explains the photos on my site.
