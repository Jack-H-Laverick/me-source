abstract: Mesophotic coral ecosystems have been studied for almost as long as researchers have studied shallow coral
  reefs. This may be surprising, given that the term mesophotic was coined as recently as 2008. At their shallowest, most
  agree, mesophotic reefs are found between depths of 30 and 40 m. This reef zone then extends to the limit of
  photosynthetic activity in hard corals, a maximum depth of about 165 m. The mesophotic zone has been further divided
  into an upper and lower mesophotic zone either side of a global 60 m depth boundary. The lower mesophotic harbors a
  biota distinct from shallow reefs, while the upper mesophotic is a transitional zone between the two. The mesophotic
  environment can be characterized as low in light, temperature, and wave action in comparison to shallow reefs.
