abstract: MCEs are often considered to be buffered from many large-scale impacts known to directly affect shallow coral
  ecosystems, such as warm-water bleaching and tropical storms. Furthermore, by virtue of their depth, and in many
  cases their remote offshore locations, some MCEs are afforded greater protection from direct human impacts, such as
  overfishing and land-based runoff. However, there is increasing evidence to suggest that MCEs are vulnerable to
  environmental disturbances, such as climate change impacts, overfishing, bottom fishing gear, capture of aquarium fish,
  precious coral trade, land-based pollution and invasive species (Table 6.1). Despite these threats, many MCEs are in
  good condition in comparison to their shallower counterparts. Strong management responses could mitigate at least some
  documented threats, thereby preventing future degradation of MCEs.
