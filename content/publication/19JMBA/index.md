abstract: "The physiology of mesophotic Scleractinia varies with depth in response to environmental change. Previous
  research has documented trends in heterotrophy and photosynthesis with depth, but has not addressed between-site
  variation for a single species. Environmental differences between sites at a local scale and heterogeneous
  microhabitats, because of irradiance and food availability, are likely important factors when explaining the occurrence
  and physiology of Scleractinia. Here, 108 colonies of Agaricia lamarcki were sampled from two locations off the coast of
  Utila, Honduras, distributed evenly down the observed 50 m depth range of the species. We found that depth alone was not
  sufficient to fully explain physiological variation. Pulse Amplitude-Modulation fluorometry and stable isotope analyses
  revealed that trends in photochemical and heterotrophic activity with depth varied markedly between sites. Our isotope
  analyses do not support an obligate link between photosynthetic activity and heterotrophic subsidy with increasing
  depth. We found that A. lamarcki colonies at the bottom of the species depth range can be physiologically similar to
  those nearer the surface. As a potential explanation, we hypothesize sites with high topographical complexity, and
  therefore varied microhabitats, may provide more physiological niches distributed across a larger depth range. Varied
  microhabitats with depth may reduce the dominance of depth as a physiological determinant. Thus, A. lamarcki may ‘avoid’
  changes in environment with depth, by instead existing in a subset of favourable niches. Our observations correlate with
  site-specific depth ranges, advocating for linking physiology and abiotic profiles when defining the distribution of
  mesophotic taxa."
