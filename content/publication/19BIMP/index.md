abstract: The Bay Islands National Marine Park (BINMP)—established in 2010—extends for approximately 6450 km2 around the
  Bay Islands off the north Caribbean coast of Honduras. Within the BINMP, MCE research has focused on the island of
  Utila, though several studies have also been conducted around Roatan and Barbareta islands. This research has indicated
  that established MCEs occur around the Bay Islands and on many offshore reef banks within the BINMP. For example, MCEs
  occur directly on the steep reef walls on the north shore of Utila and Roatan, and also on several terraces
  approximately 20 m wide that break these steep walls at depths of 30, 55, and 70 m. On the south shore of Utila, the
  gentle shallow reef slope transitions into a near-flat seabed at approximately 30-40 m depth where extensive MCE patch
  reef communities have been observed at 35-60 m depth. These patch reefs vary in area between 1-500 m2, and in some
  cases reach 3 m elevation above the seabed3. Since 2014 there has been an extensive effort to study MCEs within the
  BINMP, making them some of the best studied MCEs in the world. This note provides a brief overview of MCEs within the
  BINMP, for more extensive information please see the detailed review of Mesoamerican Reef MCEs.
