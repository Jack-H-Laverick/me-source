abstract: The sea is critical to the UK, and its future will fundamentally affect ours. Science and innovation will have
  an important part to play in shaping that future. Science holds the key to understanding the impact of a changing marine
  environment, and informing our response to it. Emerging technology will bring opportunities for new marine industries to
  develop and stimulate economic growth. It will also improve our marine science capability, not least through the marine
  autonomous vehicles that will allow us to observe and map previously unexplored places. This report brings together the
  evidence to inform the UK’s response to a diverse range of global challenges and opportunities. To be successful, it is
  clear that industry, science and policy will need to work together. Countries around the world are recognising the
  growing importance of the sea and the need to take a strategic approach to managing their marine interests. There are
  many opportunities for science, industry and policy to collaborate more closely to achieve greater marine exploration,
  protection and economic output. They all have a shared interest in a productive, healthy and well-understood sea.
  However, to be successful it is therefore important that the UK has the necessary coordination mechanisms in place. The
  UK has world-leading marine scientists and institutions. This report is the product of this excellence. It reflects the
  best available evidence across a range of disciplines, including 11 peer-reviewed evidence papers and thought pieces by
  industry leaders. We are grateful to the many people who have given their time, not least attendees at our expert
  meetings and workshops in coastal communities. In particular, we would like to thank the other members of the project’s
  expert advisory group for their considerable input and insight throughout.

summary: From Captain Cook, to Turner and the Royal Navy, the sea is embedded in our culture and history, but what will it mean for the UK to be successful maritime nation in the 21st century, and beyond? That is the key question that this report seeks to answer.
