abstract: Aim":" Coral reefs shift between distinct communities with depth throughout the world. Yet, despite over half a
  century of research on coral reef depth gradients, researchers have not addressed the driving force of these patterns.
  We present a theoretical, process-based model of light’s influence on the shallow to mesophotic reef transition as a
  single quantitative framework. We also share an interactive web application. Moving beyond depth as an ecological proxy
  will enhance research conducted on deeper coral reefs. 
  Location":" Global; subtropical and tropical coral reefs, oligotrophic and turbid coastal waters.
  Time period":" Present day (2020).  Major taxa":" Scleractinia. Methods":" We constructed ordinary differential
  equations representing the preferred light environments of shallow and mesophotic Scleractinia. We projected these as
  depth bands using light attenuation coefficients from around the world, and perform a sensitivity analysis. 
  Results":" We found light relationships alone are sufficient to capture major ecological features across coral reef
  depth gradients. Our model supports the depth limits currently used in coral reef ecology, predicting a global range for
  the shallow-upper mesophotic boundary at 36.1 m ± 5.6 and the upper lower mesophotic boundary at 61.9 m ± 9.6. However,
  our model allows researchers to move past these fixed depth limits, and quantitatively predict the depths of reef zones
  in locations around the world. Main conclusion":" The use of depth as a proxy for changes in coral reef communities
  offers no guidance for environmental variation between sites. We have shown it is possible to use light to predict the
  depth boundaries of reef zones as a continuous variable, and to accommodate this variability. Predicting the depths of
  reef zones in unusual light environments suggests that shallow-water turbid reefs should be considered as mesophotic
  coral ecosystems. Nonetheless, the current depth-based heuristics are relatively accurate at a global level.
