abstract: Background, Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) are tropical and sub-tropical reefs between 30 m and
  potentially 150 m depth, the maximum for photosynthetic hard corals. The definition’s upper boundary is ecologically
  arbitrary. Recently, research has focused on the deep reef refugia hypothesis suggesting MCEs can be protected from
  shallow-water threats, potentially acting as a local source for re-colonisation of shallow reefs. This led to recent
  calls to increase their protection. It remains unclear whether the current MCE definition reflects changing biodiversity
  with depth, and so whether protecting MCEs based on this definition will protect shallow reef species. We ask where
  shifts in ecological community structure occur across the shallow-mesophotic depth gradient. We consider to what
  extent MCEs as currently defined protect shallow reef taxa. Research on coral reef depth gradients has a long history.
  Research relevant to MCEs has been published under a variety of terms. We will use the systematic review framework
  to collect older data sources, increasing accessibility by depositing the meta-data in an online library for researchers
  and managers. Methods, A systematic review will be conducted, searching online databases, grey literature and
  personal libraries of experts. The primary question was formulated after consulting an advisory committee. Inclusion
  criteria discriminate among studies by sampling depths and community data. Critical appraisal of studies will consider
  key criteria concerning internal validity. We shall identify where more biodiversity and community-level data are
  required, determined by whether a meta-analysis is possible. Considering how to structure a meta-analysis once community
  metric and variability data have been collected will help to advise future data collection. Provided enough data are
  extracted, we shall conduct a meta-analysis examining changes in species richness, abundance and biomass across the
  depth gradient. If ecological community level data are present, we shall conduct an additional meta-analysis looking at
  community turnover with depth.
