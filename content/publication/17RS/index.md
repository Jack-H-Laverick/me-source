abstract: "Advances in understanding and technology combined with legislative change mean that deep-sea mining and marine
  genetic resource utilisation are likely to increase significantly within the next ten years. These resources share
  challenges in complexity of access, and can be co-located, but differ in the environmental impact that their access
  would involve. MINERALS: Significant deposits of metal-rich minerals are known to exist on the sea floor. Commodity
  price changes, technological progress, and changes in international agreements are likely to make deep-sea mining
  possible. Exploration activity is in progress. Exploitation of this resource is likely to begin within the next ten
  years. Environmental impact of deep-sea mining is likely to be significant. Regulations for exploitation beyond national
  jurisdictions are now in development. Processes to predict, monitor and limit damage are yet to be established, but will
  play an important role in this process. GENETIC MATERIALS: Ocean environments hold promise for useful
  chemical/biological compounds for drugs or household products. A small number of marketed products already exist from
  marine genetic resources, with some showing significant economic returns. The market could soon increase due to advances
  in surveying and gene sequencing technology. Legal considerations within national waters are well agreed, but the 
  regulatory status of marine genetic resources outside national jurisdiction is not settled and is subject to active
  international discussion."

summary: This Royal Society evidence pack draws on the expertise of Fellows of the Royal Society, and other scientists with relevant expertise, to provide a rapid and authoritative synthesis of current evidence regarding two novel classes of marine resource. While not presenting any specific recommendations, we lay out the current state of knowledge and the questions that remain to be answered.
