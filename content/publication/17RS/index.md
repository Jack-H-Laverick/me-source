abstract: Shallow water zooxanthellate coral reefs grade into ecologically distinct mesophotic coral
  ecosystems (MCEs) deeper in the euphotic zone. MCEs are widely considered to start at an
  absolute depth limit of 30m deep, possibly failing to recognise that these are distinct ecological
  communities that may shift shallower or deeper depending on local environmental conditions.
  This study aimed to explore whether MCEs represent distinct biological communities,
  the upper boundary of which can be defined and whether the depth at which they occur may
  vary above or below 30m. Mixed-gas diving and closed-circuit rebreathers were used to
  quantitatively survey benthic communities across shallow to mesophotic reef gradients
  around the island of Utila, Honduras. Depths of up to 85m were sampled, covering the vertical
  range of the zooxanthellate corals around Utila. We investigate vertical reef zonation
  using a variety of ecological metrics to identify community shifts with depth, and the appropriateness
  of different metrics to define the upper MCE boundary. Patterns observed in
  scleractinian community composition varied between ordination analyses and approaches
  utilising biodiversity indices. Indices and richness approaches revealed vertical community
  transition was a gradation. Ordination approaches suggest the possibility of recognising two
  scleractinian assemblages. We could detect a mesophotic and shallow community while
  illustrating that belief in a static depth limit is biologically unjustified. The switch between
  these two communities occurred across bathymetric gradients as small as 10m and as large
  as 50m in depth. The difference between communities appears to be a loss of shallow specialists
  and increase in depth-generalist taxa. Therefore, it may be possible to define MCEs
  by a loss of shallow specialist species. To support a biological definition of mesophotic
  reefs, we advocate this analytical framework should be applied around the Caribbean and
  extended into other ocean basins where MCEs are present.
